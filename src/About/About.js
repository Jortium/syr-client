        Stack Develeper and I really enjoy working with computer hardware as
        well as coding.That is why I came up with an idea to build a database
        for parts as well as a somewhat social media of sharing your build.In
        time as this project grows I hope to implement more to it and make it a
        sort of "social media" for computer ethuistis.Go ahead and click on the
        contact button and reach out to me if you have questions or suggestions!
